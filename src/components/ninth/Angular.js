                Angular is a powerful open-source front-end web application framework maintained by Google. It allows developers to build dynamic, single-page web applications with ease. One of its key features is its use of TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, which enables developers to write cleaner and more maintainable code by adding static typing and other features. Angular follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, where the model represents the data, the view displays the data, and the controller manages the interactions between the model and the view. Additionally, Angular provides a comprehensive set of tools and libraries for various tasks such as routing, form handling, and dependency injection, making it a robust choice for building complex web applications. With its strong community support, extensive documentation, and regular updates, Angular continues to evolve, empowering developers to create seamless and responsive web experiences.
