                React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. It provides a declarative and component-based approach to building interactive UIs, making it easier to manage and update complex applications. React's virtual DOM efficiently updates only the necessary parts of the actual DOM, resulting in faster rendering and improved performance. Its component-based architecture encourages reusability and modularity, allowing developers to compose UIs from small, isolated pieces of code. React also supports server-side rendering, making it suitable for building isomorphic web applications that can run both on the client and server. With a large and active community, extensive documentation, and a thriving ecosystem of tools and libraries, React has become one of the most popular choices for building modern web applications.
